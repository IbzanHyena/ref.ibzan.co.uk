<center>*he/they?*</center>

Ibzan is a spotted hyena (*Crocuta crocuta*).
Most of his fur is a natural colour, save for some blue highlights &mdash; notably his hair, paw pads, and tail.

Physically, Ibzan is typically of regular proportions. Around 180 cm or 5&prime;11&Prime; tall, and weighing about 80 kg or 12.5 stones (175 pounds).
His musculature is generally either reasonably well-toned or androgynous; Ibzan is rarely extremely muscled or chubby.
His legs are almost always digitigrade, rather than plantigrade.

Ibzan&rsquo;s muzzle is dark brown, transitioning to the tan fur all over his belly and innner legs by the time is reaches his face proper.
The muzzle&rsquo;s shape is also fairly boxy &mdash; it&rsquo; not especially pointy or rounded.
His ears, however, and quite round, and his eyes are brown.

Ibzan&rsquo;s hair is usually scruffy and unkempt.
Occasionally, he combs it nicely.
When growing longer, his hair develops slight waves to it.
His hair continues around the back of his neck, leading to a wider &ldquo;V&rdquo;-shaped patch of blue fur on his back.

As a *spotted* hyena, Ibzan is naturally covered in spots.
They are dark brown and appear all over his arms, legs, tail, neck, and back.
Notably, the spots only appear on his darker fur &mdash; not on his belly.

The blue highlight on Ibzan&rsquo;s tail can be depicted either as a dipstick style or travelling all the way along the underside to the base of the tail.
A dipstick is the default, however.

Ibzan&rsquo;s paw pads are blue &mdash; a deeper blue than his hair &mdash; and his claws are black.
His hands have four fingers and a thumb, and his feet have four toes.
Compared to a typical canine, the toe beans are significantly larger, and the toes are more spread out.
His claws are usually short, but can be depicted as long and sharp.

Ibzan wears a variety of clothing, but his most common outfit is a khaki shirt worn loosely, a black leather jacket, and some blue jeans.
Well-worn, but not ripped.

## Some gotchas

These are some common things to look out for in Ibzan&rsquo;s design.

- **Ears** &mdash; Ibzan&rsquo;s ears are round, not pointy.
- **Muzzle** &mdash; Ibzan&rsquo;s muzzle is relatively flat, both on top and at the front.
  It slopes downwards from his forehead quickly and then continues almost flat until his nose.
- **Spots** &mdash; Ibzan&rsquo;s spots are roughly circular, not too long in any particular direction, but not perfectly round.
  There is a variety of sizes of spots.
  Finally, the density of spots should be neither too sparse nor too dense, as per the reference images.
- **Fur** &mdash; Most of Ibzan&rsquo;s fur is relatively short.
  It shouldn&rsquo;t be visibly hanging (unless wet), save for the longer, fluffier bits of fur around his neck and back.
