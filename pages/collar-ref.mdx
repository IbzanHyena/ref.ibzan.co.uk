    # Collar Reference
</center>

Ibzan often wears a collar.
While in different contexts he might wear different ones, the version here is the one he wears most often.

The collar is made of simple pink webbing, with a metal buckle to fasten it.
There is a loop of webbing to hold the end of the collar in place.
It has a small metal tag on a loop that hangs down from the front.
Generally the tag doesn&rsquo;t have anything written on it, but it could in close-up detail shots.
The end of the collar has a metal tip to prevent fraying.

The exact dimensions of the collar are not important as long as it looks right on Ibzan in proportion.

Optionally, the collar can have additional decorations along the webbing.
The two examples provided are spikes and hearts &mdash; other options might be requested, too.
By default, though, the collar has no further decoration.

Most notably, the collar might have additional attachment points (such as D-rings) for clipping a leash to.
This is preferable to clipping the leash to the same one as the tag if the leash needs to come off at a different angle, such as behind or directly in front of Ibzan.

When worn, the collar should look snug &mdash; not too tight, but without any gaps either.
It usually sits around the bottom of Ibzan&rsquo;s neck, near where it meets his body.

## Omitting details

This reference has a lot of fine detail in it.
For example, the metal tip, the design of the buckle, and the eyelets around the notches.
This detail **can be omitted** in shots where it would be too small, distracting, or not relevant.

## Gotchas

Even a collar reference can have some easy-to-overlook things.
How &rsquo;bout that?

- **Buckle** &mdash; the buckle is *wider* than the webbing.
  It has to fit the webbing through it to secure the collar.
  That said, the finer detail of the mechanism can be left out in shots where it isn&rsquo;t visible up close.
- **End** &mdash; the end of the collar points in the same direction as it is fastened, so the buckle points in the *opposite* direction.

## Colours

Note that the metallic sheen on the tag can have a variety of greys on it.
The ones provided here are just for a sample.
