    # Quad Reference
</center>

Often times, Ibzan is drawn as a quadrupedal/feral spotted hyena rather than an anthro one.
This page provides additional details for that form.

The broad physical description of Ibzan is the same, with the same colours, fur patterns, and markings.
The [main reference](/) covers these in more detail, but, in short:

- While I don&rsquo;t have a single fixed size for quad Ibzan, a typical size would be 90 cm (35.5&prime;) tall at the shoulder, 160 cm (63&prime;) long, and a weight of roughly 65 kg (10 stones or 145 lbs).
- Brown fur over most of the body, tan on the underside.
- Brown eyes.
- Dark brown muzzle.
- Pastel blue highlights on hair, mane, and tip of tail.
- Dark blue paw pads.
- Round spots on the brown body fur.

Ibzan&rsquo;s anatomy is based very closely on a real spotted hyena&rsquo;s, with some minor differences.
The main difference is that Ibzan&rsquo;s tail is much larger and fluffier than a real hyena&rsquo;s.
Also, his paws, eyes, and ears are a bit larger than a real hyena&rsquo;s.

## Gotchas

Some key elements of hyena anatomy and Ibzan&rsquo;s design as a feral to

- **Neck** &mdash; hyena necks are large, long, and muscular.
  Furthermore, they will create a bit of a bump when lying down (see the top left image in the reference).
- **Paws** &mdash; hyenas have four toes on the paw, each with a large paw pad.
  There is a dewclaw on the front legs near the first joint (the ankle).
- **Limbs** &mdash; the forelegs and hind legs bend differently.
  Notably, the &ldquo;knee&rdquo;, which is higher up the leg than in a human, bends *backwards* in the front legs, and *forwards* in the rear ones.
  This is true of most digitigrade animals.
- **Fur** &mdash; Ibzan&rsquo;s fur is relatively short, with less fluff than his anthro form around his neck and back.
  His mane, however is more prominent, and sticks out more.

## Accessories

Ibzan often wears a collar, especially when quad.
For details on the collar, see the [collar reference](/collar-ref)
